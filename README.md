### Story: <br/>
<pre>
The player is a time-traveling treasure hunter after a unique bracelet of great value. 
 
The bracelet is located inside the castle, behind a door that only the castle wizard has the key to.
 
The wizard does not care about the bracelet but is looking for a magical gem he lost and can't find 

because it is hidden from his eyes and requires the player to give it to him.
 
The wizard tells the player to go and find the potion master for information since the potion master 

was the last one to see it, and he lost his vision because of it. 
 
The player must then find the potion master in his room on the lower level. 
 
When the player finally finds the potion master, he asks him for information.
 
However, the potion master asks the player to help him finish his soup first.

The player has to add the ingredients the potion master tells him to add to the soup.

After helping him, the potion master tells the player that the gem is located somewhere in the castle. 
 
The player searches for that gem until it is found. 
 
A huge section of the basement is covered with lava, and the player has to find a creative way to cross it. 
 
In this section, and as we mentioned in the entry before, the player has to utilize his bow and arrows to 

climb the wall. That can be achieved by shooting arrows at the wall and using them to climb to the other side.

On the other side of the lava, there are three chests, and the gem is in one of them. 

After finding the gem, the player returns to the wizard, who manifests the key for the player in front of the

treasure room, where the bracelet is. 

The player uses the key to access the room and take the treasure. 

This is the end of the game.
